Left: for parties that are de_ned as communist, socialist, social democratic, or left-wing. Center: for parties that are defined as centrist or when party position can best be described as centrist (e.g. party advocates strengthening private enterprise in a social-liberal context). Not described as centrist if competing factions \"average out\" to a centrist position (e.g. a party of \"right-wing Muslims and Beijing-oriented Marxists\"). 0: for all those cases which do not fit into the above-mentioned category (i.e. partyâ€™s platform does not focus on economic issues, or there are competing wings), or no information.",
