It modifies the combined annual Polity score by applying a simple treatment, or \"\"fix,\" to convert instances of \"standardized authority scores\" (i.e., -66, -77, and -88) to conventional polity scores (i.e., within the range, -10 to +10). The values have been converted according to the following rule set-66: Cases of foreign \"interruption\" are treated as \"system missing.\"-77: Cases of \"interregnum,\" or anarchy, are converted to a \"neutral\" Polity score of \"0.\"-88: Cases of \"transition\" are prorated across the span of the transition. For example, country X has a POLITY score of -7 in 1957, followed by three years of -88 and, finally, a score of +5 in 1961. The change (+12) would be prorated over the intervening three years at a rate of per year, so that the converted scores would be as follows: 1957 -7; 1958 -4; 1959 -1; 1960 +2; and 1961 +5.",
