    "fxInfo_clarification": "The following questions pertain to the legislature, an assembly of deputies or representatives with powers to consider, pass, amend, or repeal laws. If there is no legislature in the country you are coding for some period of years, do not code any questions for those years. If you are considering a semi-sovereign territory such as a colony please answer this question with respect to the legislature that is seated within the territory in question (such as the local legislative assembly in a British colony, not the Parliament in London). A popular election need not involve universal suffrage; indeed, suffrage may be highly restricted. A \"direct election\" can include seats reserved for special groups (e.g., ethnic groups or women) so long as these members are chosen by popular election. Frequently, it is important to distinguish between formal rules (as stipulated by statute, legislative rules, the constitution, or common law precedent) and actual practice (what happens on the ground). In order to clarify the de jure/de facto distinction, we employ the terms \"by law. . . \" and \"in practice...\" Please pay close attention to these cues. Note that sometimes we ask different coders to code different aspects of a question. So, you might get a question about the de facto state of affairs, but another source might provide the answer to the de jure state of affairs.",
