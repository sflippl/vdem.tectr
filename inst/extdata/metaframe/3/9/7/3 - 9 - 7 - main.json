It does not include unpaid work; work paid for through a private collection of fees, material perquisites or bribes; private employment by a higherranking \"patron\" within the administration; contractors being paid on an irregular basis; or\"parastatals\" (those working for state-owned companies), since the latter are not paid directly out of the state coffers.
