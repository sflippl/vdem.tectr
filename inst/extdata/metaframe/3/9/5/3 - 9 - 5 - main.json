    "fxInfo_clarification": "With this question we seek to judge the extent of recognition of the preeminent authority of the state over the population. We are not interested here in perfect control by the state, or whether it is relatively effective in comparison to other states, but an assessment of the populations over which it is hegemonic, extite.g. where it is recognized as the preeminent authority and in a contest of wills it can assert its control over political forces that reject its authority. Several illustrative examples may help in this coding. During civil wars the claim of the state to rule is effectively neutralized by insurgent groups ( extite.g., the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka). There are also situations in which criminals or warlords exert control in contravention of state authority ( extite.g. opium growers in parts of Indochina). There are also cases of failed states where the central government cannot assert control over a share of its territory ( extite.g., contemporary Somalia). Here, we ask you to estimate the population that the state has effective control over, as a percentage (By \"population\" we refer to international law. In cases where international law is not entirely clear, we refer you to general understandings. For example, China claims sovereignty over Taiwan, but it remains under the control of its own government. For purposes of this question, the existence of Taiwan should not be considered an example of the PRCâ€™s failure to control its territory.",
