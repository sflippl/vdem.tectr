These two variables correlate at .98. This compiled time series is interpolated increasing the number of observations from 3,927 to 9,308. Missing data for the base variable is then imputed from UNESCO’s total secondary enrollment percentage, which includes those enrolled who are not of secondary-school age. The linear imputation increases the number of obervations from 11,080 to 12,317.",
